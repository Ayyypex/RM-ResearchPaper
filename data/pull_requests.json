It also improves performance by eliminating code that runs for no reason.\r\n\r\nPreviously, when using the `dynamic` keymap legend style, pressing CapsLock would use the \"capitalized\" version of every key, and pressing Shift would do the same, but it would also effectively \"invert\" the state of CapsLock.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by that is that if you press CapsLock, every key \"capitalizes,\" but then if you also hold Shift, it will go back to lowercase. As it turns out, Shift inverting the state of CapsLock does not happen on MacOS. So I provided an edge case to rule out MacOS from that behavior.\r\n\r\nCapsLock also only capitalizes letters, not symbols, but Shift does both. So I have two different states managing the capitalization of letters and symbols.\r\n\r\nFinally, if the user is using `oppositeShiftMode`, then the keymap will only capitalize what they can press.

It adds to the existing codebase, continuing to leverage the Web Audio API  to allow for a new type - musical scales (major, minor, pentatonic, blues etc). \r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, the pentatonic scale is a set of notes that sounds pleasant regardless of rhythm or order because of how it's arranged - free of any semitone differences between every note, which the human ear perceives as \"bad sounding\". The code within this PR is the C pentatonic scale, shown below. For context, I learned about this because of some quirky high school jazz band theory. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46613983/216741320-b3a3d26c-47ff-46f9-91f5-38df10f2a097.png)\r\n\r\nIf interested, check out this [link](https://www.percussionplay.com/five-notes-to-rule-them-all/#:~:text=Why%20does%20the%20Pentatonic%20Scale,the%20notes%20in%20the%20scale.) for more information about why the pentatonic scale sounds nice. \r\n\r\nIt's especially interesting because the words per minute directly correspond to the rhythm of the sound, which gives the user full control over the rhythm of the music.

By implementing an optional `customStyle` property of type `string` to the `Command` interface,  we could easily style certain dropdown options by passing in CSS strings when we are pushing each `Command` object into it's respective `CommandsSubgroup`. Here are some examples I made with this new `customStyle` property: \r\n\r\n<img width=\"2168\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46613983/210121364-4981091a-f349-4365-bfd9-e954b81611c7.png\">\r\n\r\nThis might make the theme selection more intuitive.

This gives time for `Enter` to be the prevailing key in the niche case above, and for the first returning key to resume normal operation.\r\n\r\nGiven every key will autofocus the test, the delay will never be present to affect typing as the the first keydown event will autofocus regardless after 200ms, or immediately if esc or tab, i.e. no delayed keystrokes appearing in typing test, no infinite debounce.", "created_at": "2022-12-16T05:51:48Z", "closed_at": "2023-01-06T12:37:35Z", "merged_at": "2023-01-06T12:37:35Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "merged": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_review_comments": 0, "num_commits": 7, "num_additions": 25, "num_deletions": 2, "num_changed_files": 3, "first_response_at": "2022-12-25T20:34:00Z"}, {"title": "Monkey 15", "body": "<!-- Adding a language or a theme?\r\nFor languages, make sure to edit the `_list.json`, `_groups.json` files, and add the `language.json` file as well.\r\n For themes, make sure to add the `theme.css` file.

Love does not depend on our will, comes without our merit, disappears without our fault.\r\n2. What right do you have to be free when your people are in captivity? What right do you have to satisfy your whims and love desires when millions of your people have nothing to satisfy the most basic needs of life?\r\n3. Law! It is understood, and we have heard something about the law, but we know all too well that the law is a theory that in a book, on paper, it looks very good, but in practice, living reality has its own special laws, far from being so smooth and rounded, but full of ramifications, spells and heterogeneities.\r\n4. All that goes beyond the frame of the nation is either the [pharisaism](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pharisaism) of people who, by international ideals, would be happy to cover up their contests for the domination of one nation over another, or the morbid sentimentalism of science fiction writers who would be happy to cover their spiritual alienation from their native nation with broad all-human phrases.\r\n5. My patriotism is not sentiment, not national pride, but a heavy yoke.\r\n // yoke is a collar placed on the neck of a conquered person or prisoner to restrain movement\r\n6. And we have either such a nature or such a long-standing custom, it is enough that whoever gets rich turns his face and heart away from the people from whom he came.\r\n7. Life is my treasure, my own, lonely, of which the smallest particle, the one minute of, are not worth all the treasures of the world. No one has the right to crave the slightest sacrifice from my treasure, just as I do not crave such a sacrifice from anyone.\r\n8. The school of political life is like a swimming school. Standing on the shore and listening to theoretical presentations and assumptions, no one in the world has yet learned to swim like that. Here the first thing is your own test, your own activity, your own skills and your own courage. That's what we have to teach our peasants. Let them speak for themselves, let them learn to express their own needs and wrongs, to stand behind their lusts and against their masters.\r\n9. Language grows elementary, along with the soul of the people.\r\n10. The literature of every nation is the best mirror of its life.\r\n---\r\n#### Quotes by [Ivan Kotliarevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Kotliarevsky):\r\n11. For whom lives honestly and feeds on his labors a piece of stale bread is tastier than a piece of soft one, that was untruthfully acquired.\r\n---\r\n#### Quotes by [Taras Shevchenko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taras_Shevchenko):\r\n12. And do not consider the moskals (// Historically a neutral designation for a person from Muscovy), let them write in their own way, and we in our own way. They have a nation and a word, and we have a nation and a word. Let people judge whose better.\r\n---\r\n#### Quotes by [Andrey Sheptytsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Sheptytsky):\r\n13. No man has the natural right to rule another person against their will. Therefore, power should be formed on the basis of free and conscious elections.\r\n14. A crime committed in the name of patriotism is the greater the crime against the people, the more it can be liked, the more it can be a reason for praise, for the consolation of what is evil. Every crime that is patriotic, the more it can be liked by badly understood patriotism is temptation, a force that leads the people to a state in which the concepts of good and evil are starting to be erased, mixed and interceded mutually. Along the way that low, poorly understood and sensual patriotism likes, contagion spreads, devouring the best, the most noblest national forces.\r\n15. It is easier sometimes to shed blood in one wave of enthusiasm, than for many years to hardly perform duties, to bear the heat of the day and the heat of the sun, the anger of people and the hatred of enemies, the lack of their care and the lack of help from those closest to you; And in the midst of such work, until the end, to carry out your task, without waiting for laurels before the victory or rewards before the merit.\r\n---\r\n#### Quotes by [Mykhailo Kotsiubynsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mykhailo_Kotsiubynsky):\r\n16. I can still handle being insulted as a person, but when my people, my language, my culture are insulted, how can I not react to it?\r\n17. It was so quiet that I felt ashamed of the pounding of my own heart.\r\n18. The people are being eaten pranci(//alternative name of syphilis), the need and vodka, but they still eat each other in the dark.\r\n19. I confess - I envy the planets: they have their own orbits, and nothing is standing in their way. Whereas I always meet a person in my way. // Tried my best translating, but it doesn't seem to make much sense in English, but in Ukrainian it does.\r\n20. I am tired. I am tired of people. I am annoyed to be a place, where these creatures are crowding, screaming, fussing and littering. Open the window! Run the house! Would like to throw  away the litter along with those who litter. Let cleanliness and calmliness enter the house. What will give me the comfort of being alone?

The mass of people broke up, dispersed and spread across the field. Everyone went home fully satisfied that they had seen this disgraceful and heart-wrenching game. Peter looked around and saw that no one was staying here. The army also left, only two guards remained near gallows. That red-shirted man also changed into some other clothes and left. The unfortunate child was left hanging motionless.\r\n\r\n18) Only here ended the funeral march in four parts, which included the southern sun, the sadness of Tbilisi, the horn of a car, the noise of a propeller, the roar of a Paris coffee house, the slow rustle of Chinese silk, the boundless respect of Bromley, the envious smile of Tino, the slithering of a snake on a woman's flawless body, a secret spell and all This was surrounded by the roar of the spirit warrior Shalva.

This does consistently add the space between paragraphs and does not confuse acronyms, though.\r\n\r\nCloses #2112 and extends on PR [#2193](https://github.com/Miodec/monkeytype/pull/2193)", "created_at": "2021-12-19T18:20:12Z", "closed_at": "2021-12-20T13:05:03Z", "merged_at": "2021-12-20T13:05:03Z", "author_association": "MEMBER", "merged": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_review_comments": 0, "num_commits": 1, "num_additions": 7, "num_deletions": 5, "num_changed_files": 1, "first_response_at": "2021-12-20T01:04:29Z"}, {"title": "Fix for Wikipedia newline issue", "body": "\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR uses regex to try and replace the missing gap in the wikipedia text.

The accented vowels look like this: \u00e1, \u00e9, \u00ed, \u00f3, \u00fa. In the Spanish keyboard layout we have a dedicated key that we have to press before a vowel in order to put the accent mark on it. So for the word \"tambi\u00e9n\" we have to type the sequence of keys \" t a m b i \u00b4 e n \". As you can probably tell, it is very common to miss that accent mark and just write \"tambien\" (with no accent mark). This is technically a typo, but in a non professional or casual context people won't mind about that mistake. That's why I took the spanish.json as a baseline and created the spanish_no_accents.json file. The difference is that the words don't have accent marks. The main reason for this change is that it's very frequent to miss the accent mark on a vowel while doing a typing test, and that counts as an error. I think that with this change, lazy Spanish people like me would be really happy!\r\n", "created_at": "2021-12-07T18:33:29Z", "closed_at": "2021-12-08T02:36:13Z", "merged_at": "2021-12-08T02:36:13Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "merged": false, "num_comments": 3, "num_review_comments": 0, "num_commits": 1, "num_additions": 209, "num_deletions": 1, "num_changed_files": 3, "first_response_at": "2021-12-07T18:33:32Z"}, {"title": "added GMK Mecha_01 theme", "body": "Here's a photo of the Mecha_01 theme.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83473782/145083546-d4c87f63-4ed0-4ca9-8e8d-55bacfebe5ba.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis theme is based off GMK Mecha_01.

But I wanted to make sure I didn't pick up any bad habits, so I want my min accuracy set to 95%. The issue with that is that if I make a mistake at the start I'm immediately dead. This feature tries to mitigate that by reducing the impact of errors at the start of each test.\r\n\r\n### How\r\n\r\nThis PR as well as adding the setting and its corresponding frontend and command line entry, modifies the way the players accuracy is calculated in `test-timer.js` by conditionally calling a new function in `test-stats.js` if the setting is on.\r\nhttps://github.com/Miodec/monkeytype/blob/15bbef6260b0eae49949379fbffaf7ec2d6402e6/src/js/test/test-timer.js#L41\r\nThis new function will multiply `accuracy.incorrect` with a fraction based on the `minAccCustom` config value and the total keystroke count before completing the accuracy calculation as usual.  \r\nThe new funktion:\r\n```js\r\nexport function calculateAccuracyWithGrace() {\r\n  const graceCharacters = Config.minAccCustom / 2.5;\r\n  const grace =\r\n    Math.min(accuracy.correct + accuracy.incorrect, graceCharacters) /\r\n    graceCharacters;\r\n  const incorrect = accuracy.incorrect * grace;\r\n  return (accuracy.correct / (accuracy.correct + incorrect)) * 100;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe precise calculation feels ok to me at this point, its not helping to much, just enough, but this is just my thoughts, so I'd be happy to hear your thoughts too.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nI have been using this a good bit locally to tweak the function, and everything seems to work as intended. However I've not written any tests or similar for the function. I did however do my best to keep to the same style and structure as the project.

Server interacts with the local Mongo database through mongoose. Mongoose models are in the `backend/models` folder with subschemas inside the subschemas folder. Server interacts with the frontend through `/api/` routes. Everything that could be copy/pasted from the old code was, so that new bugs could be avoided.

The Filipino words are tricky also since they have subtle variations. But, I think could be mainly grouped as formal and informal variants. Formal is more in the contexts of formal writing, and the informal more in the context of social chatting. And I agree that it's better to use the formal variants also so that Filipinos will not forget their original forms. Aside from that, we avoided:\r\n- words with punctuation (e.g. `pag-ibig`)\r\n- words with capitalization (e.g. `Diyos` or `Pinoy`)\r\n- duplicated/similar words\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to @Killer8Hyper for helping with the improved list.

I'd really like this to be implemented because I feel this way the actual releases would have more value and be more stable (more testing from community users, less bugs encountered by casual users). The changelog also becomes more consistent with previous versions\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n1. Add a new site: Firebase console > Hosting > Advanced > Add another site\r\n2. Set up a domain/subdomain for the site: `testing.monkeytype.com` and `unstable.monkeytype.com` are ones that I personally like. I don't think `beta` would be correct here, because it's use is more common for pre-release/ready-to-use versions. (Though you could add as many sites/targets as you like, and beta could be one of them!)\r\n3. Set up `.firebaserc` according to `.firebaserc_example` or use `firebase use` (which I think does the same thing). I say this just in case you don't have it set up, since `package.json` has the `-P monkey-type` flag, which I removed in this PR to make it less \"hardcoded\"\r\n4. Set up targets locally:\r\n```shell\r\nfirebase target:apply hosting release <release-site-id>\r\nfirebase target:apply hosting unstable <unstable-site-id>\r\n```\r\nNotes:\r\n* The deployment scripts for each channel is called `deploy:live:<channel>`. `deploy:live:functions` is still functions.\r\n* The commands from step 4 edit `.firebaserc` and save the target to site-name linking there.\r\n\r\nAnd that's about it! I'm pretty sure I didn't miss anything, All the steps are explained in more detail in the Firebase [docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/multisites) if you want to check them out\r\n\r\nEdit: Another good subdomain: `dev.`\r\n", "created_at": "2021-02-03T04:27:24Z", "closed_at": "2022-03-20T18:58:44Z", "merged_at": "2022-03-20T18:58:44Z", "author_association":

ISO keyboards are the default in European countries but in the current version of the app, this key cannot be mapped to anything. \r\n\r\nA side effect of this fix is that the key lookup system is simplified. \r\n\r\nDetailed explanation follows:\r\n\r\nThe existing code essentially does a two-step process to lookup a key:\r\n1. keyboard event code  -->  qwerty mapping\r\n2. qwerty mapping --> selected layout mapping.\r\n\r\nA consequence of this approach is that keys cannot be mapped unless they exist in the default ANSI qwerty set. For example, the key event for the extra ISO key mentioned above is \"IntlBackslash\", but it's not possible to add this as there is already a mapping to Backslash.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this problem, this patch simplifies the key lookup to a single step process:\r\nkeyboard event code -->  selected layout mapping\r\n\r\nThe existing Qwerty defaults (\"qwertyMasterLayout\") are replaced by a simple array, keyEventCodes, which defines the list of keys that should be in the layout mapping. Notice I have added IntlBackslash just before Z. Consequently, I have also added a mapping for this key (usually the backslash character) to each of the layout mappings. On ANSI boards, this key doesn't exist, so the event won't be called. As an aside, on the Azerty keyboard, this extra key is actually \"<>\", so a side effect of this change is that Azerty support is improved too.\r\n\r\nNow, coming on to my motivation for this patch in the first place, I wanted to fix the [Colemak-DH ](http://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/gfx/colemak_dh_keyb_iso.png)and [Colemak-DHk](http://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/gfx/colemak_dhk_keyb_iso.png) layouts, as they should use the [angle mod](https://colemakmods.github.io/ergonomic-mods/angle.html), and on ISO keyboards, the extra ISO key should be mapped to Z, So I have fixed those too. For ANSI users, there should be no effect as the IntlBackslash event won't be triggered, and in the Colemak-DH layout files, Z is still mapped to the Qwerty B key as before, so ANSI users should not see any change.\r\n", "created_at": "2020-10-28T18:29:14Z", "closed_at": "2020-10-30T00:07:43Z", "merged_at": "2020-10-30T00:07:43Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "merged": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_review_comments": 0, "num_commits": 2, "num_additions": 70, "num_deletions": 73, "num_changed_files": 2, "first_response_at": "2020-10-29T00:35:32Z"}, {"title": "Added package.json.

It's basically a consolidation of commands that can be enabled or triggered.\r\n\r\nEarly version demo here: https://discordapp.com/channels/713194177403420752/713196019206324306/764527921670389821\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2020-10-11T17:01:46Z", "closed_at": "2020-10-14T13:05:39Z", "merged_at": "2020-10-14T13:05:39Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "merged": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_review_comments": 0, "num_commits": 18, "num_additions": 147, "num_deletions": 5, "num_changed_files": 5, "first_response_at": "2020-10-14T13:05:42Z"}, {"title": "Pastel", "body": "Simple theme featuring all pastel colors.\r\n![pastel_theme_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33403572/95566079-f18a7880-09d5-11eb-825a-20a024fdbdb3.png)\r\n", "created_at": "2020-10-09T09:20:36Z", "closed_at": "2020-10-09T14:09:17Z", "merged_at": "2020-10-09T14:09:17Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "merged": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_review_comments": 0, "num_commits": 3, "num_additions": 16, "num_deletions": 0, "num_changed_files": 2, "first_response_at": ""}, {"title": "Lil Dragon Theme", "body": "Added theme for Lil Dragon\r\n\r\n[Lil Dragon](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=108950.0)", "created_at": "2020-10-09T06:39:15Z", "closed_at": "2020-10-09T14:18:07Z", "merged_at": "2020-10-09T14:18:07Z", "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "merged": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_review_comments": 0, "num_commits": 4, "num_additions": 24, "num_deletions": 0, "num_changed_files": 2, "first_response_at": ""}, {"title": "Fixed missing 'on' button text in settings under blind mode", "body": "I've described this issue in detail [here](https://github.com/Miodec/monkey-type/issues/409) in detail.
